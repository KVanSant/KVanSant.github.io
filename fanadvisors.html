    <h3>Project Goal</h3>
    <p>To redesign and develop a new modern website that would replace the previous website.</p>
    <h3>My Role</h3>
    <p>Web Designer and Developer</p>
    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <p>Because their previous website had very little content, we needed to work together to build the rich content they would need for the new site. They also wanted a portion of the website to be password protected and only accessible to their team and advisors. This part of the site would hold documents and videos that would need to be updated regularly.</p>
    <h3>Solutions</h3>
    <p>Used Perch for their CMS and Foundation as a framework. Perch allowed the clients to have a custom website design, fulfilled their need to have a password protected area of the site, as well as allow them to update their content regularly. Foundation aided in bringing the site to life in a more timely manner and provided the needed structure for the clients "Resource Portal".</p>
